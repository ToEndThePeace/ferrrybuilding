# San Francisco Ferry Building Rebrand

A project where students were tasked to create a new website for the San Francisco Ferry Building using only our own images and taking content from the site itself.

This site is very simple and was created in 2013. "Float" rather than flexbox is used as that was what we were learning at the time, and a custom CSS grid system was implemented to neatly lay out columns.

## Notable Features

- Visitor Information Page
  - alignment and layout was challenging to accomplish considering the technologies we were using at the time
  - using floats I was able to lay the hours of operation out quite nicely

- Nested Navigation Bar
  - not necessarily difficult to implement, but something that I had never done before this project
  
- Fullscreen background image
  - this wasn't learned in class, so I had to search the internet to figure out how to accomplish my desired effect
 
- Relevant design style
  - As I was in art school at the time, a major focus of the project was designing a site that encompassed the feeling and culture of being in the San Francisco Ferry Building, and I believe that I achieved that quite nicely
